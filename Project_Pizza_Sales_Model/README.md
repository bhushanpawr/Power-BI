To find opportunities to increase sales and improve productivity, we have analysed the data in this PowerBI project and created a dashboard. At Plato's, things are going alright, but they could be better. For the past year, we have been gathering transactional data,Â  but really haven't been able to put it to good use.

Here are some questions that we solved in this project:

Q1 What days and times do we tend to be busiest?

Q2 How many pizzas are we making during peak periods?

Q3 What are our best and worst-selling pizzas?

Q4 What's our average order price?

Q5 What is the sales by category

In this visual i get a busiest day of the week by taking day-name and quantity of order. so i have created a new measure on order date column called "month name" by using **Day = FORMAT('Table'[order_date],"dddd")** this DAX formula.

Conclusion is that more pizza are ordered on Friday followed by Thursday and Saturday for the year.
